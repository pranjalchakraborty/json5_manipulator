SCRIPTS:

1. field_editor.exe -

Use: Takes a particular field's value of all items. Adds adder to it and then multiplies by multiplier.
 

Reason: You may use to increase field by a adder (+5) and/or multiplier (ex.10). 

Any valid numerical fields may be adjusted.


Fields: 
input_folder = folder name containing files to be changed
output_folder = folder name containing changed files
# ../. = Do NOT change. Points to location of folder containing run.exe
adder: Integer value. Added first.
multiplier: Integer value. Multiplied second.


2. merge_json.exe -

Use: Merge the original or existing JSON files with the same JSON files from mods.

Reason: Merge.

Fields: 
input_folder = folder name containing files to be changed
change_folder = folder name containing new files that show how files are to be changed - edit or add items
output_folder = folder name containing changed files
# ../. = Do NOT change. Points to location of folder containing run.exe
# example - input_folder = original or currently existing files, change_folder = mod_files desired to be integrated into existing files
# If multiple mods add same file, you must merge them multiple times 
array_merge_strategy - array of strings - ignore or merge or replace
new_id_strategy - ignore or merge
